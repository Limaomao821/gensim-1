0.0 The Gensim Toolset
------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.1 Get Started

0.1.0 Install dependencies

GenSim is developed primarily on Fedora 26, and tested mainly on Fedora 
26, Debian 9.3 (Stretch) and Ubuntu 14.04. 

For Fedora 26, the following dependencies must be installed (using dnf):
	autoconf
	automake
	findutils
	gcc-arm-linux-gnu
	gcc-c++
	java-1.8.0-openjdk
	mercurial
	make 
	ncurses-devel
	openssh-clients
	wget
	zlib-devel

For Ubuntu, the following dependencies must be installed (using apt-get):
	autoconf
	gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi
	g++
	libncurses5-dev
	make
	mercurial
	openjdk-7-jre
	wget
	zlib1g-dev

0.1.1 Building the Toolset

You probably just want to know how to get everything compiled! The 
default configuration of Gensim and Archsim have very few dependencies, 
so you should be able to install those dependencies, type 'make', press 
return, and have everything compile.

$ make
... sometime later ...

$ # all done!

You might receive an error similar to:

arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc: Command not found

You'll need to check the arm cross compiler prefix in archsim/.config
(ARM_CC_PREFIX) and set it correctly depending on which arm cross 
compiler you have installed. For Fedora, this is arm-linux-gnu-, and for
Ubuntu it should be arm-linux-gnueabi-.

If you want to build the system with optimisation enabled (which is 
recommended if you want to use it to perform simulations), then specify
the 'OPT' flag:

$ make OPT=1
... some longer time later ...

... etc ...


0.1.2 Running a simulation

A script is provided to easily run an ARMv7-A simulation:

$ echo 'int main(int argc, char **argv) { printf("Hello world!\n"); return 0; }' > hello.c
$ arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-gcc hello.c -static -o hello-arm
$ scripts/archsim-armv7a-user hello-arm
Hello world!


It is generally recommended to statically compile applications which you
intend to simulate. Dynamically linked applications are supported but
this requires more in-depth setup.


0.2 Introduction

Gensim is an ADL toolset designed around developing high performance
simulation tools. Often, when developing a simulator, an ad-hoc approach
is taken, meaning that developing a simulator requires deep knowledge
of the architecture under simulation, and of simulation technologies in
general. ADLs (Architecture Description Languages) such as Gensim can
be used to remove this second requirement.

The Gensim Toolset is structured as follows:
 1. The Gensim Compiler can be used to compile and analyse Models
 2. The Archsim Simulator can be used to simulate systems using those
    models.
 3. Several Models are provided

Documentation for each part of the Toolset can be found in the 
corresponding directory.
